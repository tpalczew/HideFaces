## Main Goal

- I built a pipeline that tests different object detection algorithms that will be used for hiding the identity of persons within the uploaded still pictures.

- Two algorithms were implemented and tested:

  - A standard computer vision algorithm, the [Haar cascade classifier](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~efros/courses/LBMV07/Papers/viola-cvpr-01.pdf), commonly used in business aplications. This choice is motivated by the simplicity of approach and time constraints. This model served as a core of my minimum viable product and baseline that is compared to more sophisticated and challenging approaches. The Haar cascade classifier used in this project was previously trained on [frontal face images](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades/).

  - A state-of-the-art deep learning algorithm, from the single stage detector family, [You Only Look Once](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02640.pdf) (YOLO). YOLO looks at the whole image at test time, so its predictions are informed by a global context in the image. At the same time a single neural network predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities that allows to perform end-to-end optimization directly on detection performance.


If one would like to train Haar from scratch, this post presents all necessary steps in detail:

[https://memememememememe.me/post/training-haar-cascades](https://memememememememe.me/post/training-haar-cascades/)

The YOLO implementation is based on Keras (high-level neural networks API). I decided to perform transfer learning for YOLO model that was previously trained on [COCO Dataset](http://cocodataset.org). This project borrows a lot of code from this git-hub repository:

## Setup, requisites, environment settings, and tests
- To clone repo, set environment variables and install needed libraries
```
git clone https://github.com/tpalczew/HideFaces.git
cd HideFaces
source ./build/environment.sh
pip install -r build/requirements.txt
```
The model weights are located online [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/k2s1uqnns4an1l4/AABriaeHeWELrsvug-g-IhsLa?dl=0).
One needs to move these weights to the following locations:

- /data/preprocessed/model_weights/haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml

- /data/preprocessed/retrained_models/large_weights_face_yolo_v2.h5


This project was developed and tested on AWS E2 instance using Deep Learning AMI (Ubuntu) Version 15.0 (ami-0b43cec40e1390f34)
using python3. The pip freeze for this specific setting can be found [here](https://github.com/tpalczew/HideFaces/blob/master/static/aws-e2-requirements.txt).

- All tests are placed in the HideFaces/tests/ directory. The tests.py script runs all tests:
```
cd tests
python tests.py
```
as an output one should see a similar information:

</p>

The tests.py script performs nine different tests that target different parts of the code. The tested parts are as follows:

- function to calculate an intersection over union value for two bounding boxes

- interval overlap function that is used during the calculation of an intersection over union value

- sigmoid and softmax functions

- correctness of the data shapes (for both algorithms: Haar and YOLO) after preprocessing process


## Run Inference
Face detection and blurring on a single image may be performed using command line script
```
python app.py --infile /dir/subdir/file.jpg --outfile /dir/subdir/file_blur.jpg --blur blur_type --model model_type
```

Available blur types are as follows: median blur (use medianBlur), Gaussian blur (use GaussianBlur), bilateral filter (use bilateralFilter), averaging (use blur). The default blur is a 'median blur'.


There are two models that can be used to detect faces: Haar cascade classifier (use haar) or YOLO (use yolov2).
The default model is a Haar cascade classifier.


## Serve Model

I prepared a Flask webapp that you can activate using app_flask.py script

```
python app_flask.py
```

and than browse to http://localhost:5000 and as an outcome you should see options to select model, blur type, and upload your picture.

## Datasets & Data Augmentation

In the end, I decided to only focus on examples from two public datasets, WIDER face ([link](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/WIDERFace/)), Kaggle face dataset ([link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/face-recognition/data)), and my pictures. To colect own pictures, I used google_images_download.py script from [https://github.com/hardikvasa/google-images-download](https://github.com/hardikvasa/google-images-download) and drew bounding boxes using RectLabel software. As the number of examples was sufficient for my task, I have not performed data augmentation. Hovever, if you need to augment your dataset for object detection, one of many possible options is to use this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Paperspace/DataAugmentationForObjectDetection)


## Transfer learning for YOLO

The script (retrain_yolo_v2.py) to retrain yolo algorithm is located in

src/preprocess/

it needs YOLO COCO weights ([yolo.weights](https://www.dropbox.com/s/so0ughetp8132w7/yolo.weights?dl=0)) that should be located in data/preprocessed/model_weights/ directory.
In addition, images and annotations for retraining should be located in the following locations:

 - train image folder = /data/raw/face/large/train/

 - train annotation folder = /data/raw/face/large/train_ann/

 - valid image folder = /data/raw/face/large/val/

To run retraining script:
```
python retrain_yolo_v2.py --out_model serialized_model_to_json --out_weights serialized_weights --out_full serialized_full_model
```

it will store all the configuration information to /data/preprocessed/config_yolo.json
